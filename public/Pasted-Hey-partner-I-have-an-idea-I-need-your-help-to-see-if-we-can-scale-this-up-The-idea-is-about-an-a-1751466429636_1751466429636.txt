Hey partner, I have an idea. I need your help to see if we can scale this up. The idea is about an app called Billboard. Now, Billboard is going to be an online advertising platform, purely advertising. Now, the question is how do we get traffic to this advertising platform? It's a place that is going to be clouded with deals, coupons, anything that will make people search for goods and stuff and services. We want to place a way to get a lot of deals being pushed there to generate a lot of traffic. Then we have a very big billboard that will be segmented and have people advertise on the billboard. So we take it as a concept on the roadside and then put it in virtual. Tell me what you think and give me your idea and your advice. Be my expert on this.


ChatGPT said:
Hey partner — I love the core concept of Billboard. You're essentially digitizing the psychological magnetism of roadside advertising and turning it into a deal-first digital destination that doubles as a prime monetizable ad space. Here’s my expert breakdown and a roadmap for scaling this into something powerful:

🎯 Concept Summary: “Billboard”
An online advertising platform that:

Focuses purely on deals, offers, and services

Showcases everything in a giant digital billboard layout

Attracts users by aggregating the best deals, coupons, and discounts

Offers segmented “billboard space” for advertisers to buy and place ads (geo, interest, or vertical-based)

🔥 Why This Could Work
Deals drive traffic — think Slickdeals, Honey, Groupon, but with a flashier, more interactive "Times Square" feel

The billboard metaphor is sticky: everyone understands it

You’re building both demand (users) and supply (advertisers) simultaneously

It can become location-aware and trend-driven, boosting engagement

💡 Monetization Strategy
Segmented Ad Slots (Primary)
Sell “billboard real estate” to brands, e-commerce stores, and service providers. Use:

CPM (Cost per 1,000 Impressions)

CPC (Cost per Click)

Flat-fee for premium, rotating, or pinned placements

Affiliate Revenue (Secondary)
Integrate affiliate links from Amazon, ShareASale, CJ, Impact, etc., so each deal shown earns a commission.

Sponsored Deals / Listings
Let vendors pay to “pin” their deals higher or appear in a larger space.

Local Business Packages
Offer packages to restaurants, barbershops, or regional stores to appear based on the user’s geolocation.

🚦Getting Traffic: 7 Proven Strategies
1. Deal Aggregation + SEO Magnet
Scrape or sync deals from affiliate networks (Amazon, Rakuten, TravelPayouts, etc.)

Auto-generate landing pages per category, deal type, or product

Focus SEO around:

“Best deals today [date]”

“Coupons near me”

“Billboard discounts for [niche]”

2. Browser Extension
Lightweight Chrome/Firefox extension that shows a “mini billboard” every time users open a tab.

Incentive: auto-detect discounts while browsing.

3. Mobile Push App + Location Deals
Use GPS to show hyperlocal billboard deals — gas, food, stores nearby

Add reward points or gamify check-ins (“Today’s Best Billboard Deal”)

4. TikTok + Instagram Reels Strategy
“Billboard Finds” — daily reels showcasing wild new discounts

Influencers post “What’s on today’s Billboard?” with referral links

5. Reddit + Forums Integration
Launch your own subreddit: r/DigitalBillboardDeals

Scrape or share new entries across r/Deals, r/Frugal, r/Coupons

6. Newsletter + Notifications
Daily or weekly curated “Billboard Wrap-Up” email

Push notification via app or browser for flash sales

7. Embed Widget for Others
Offer small sites or creators an embeddable “Top Billboard Deals” widget

Expands your presence across the web

You said:
We also need to create an option for users to prompt for ads to be created for them. So user will put in what kind of ad he wants, video, text, graphic, whatever. And then AI agent will go create it. User review. And then select all the options. Make payment. And then push it out. And then users can also manually create their own, using their own assets. And submit for review. And payment. What do you think? We need to add that to the MVP.


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely.
